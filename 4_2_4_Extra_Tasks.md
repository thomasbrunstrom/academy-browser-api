## Task 1b:

Create a dice tool in HTML / JavaScript. The user should be able to press a button, or press a keyboard key. And a dice should be viewed. Use Math.random() to decide which number the dice rolls. And use images of dices to show the correct side of the dice, corresponding with the random number.

## Task 1b:

Extend the dice tool by adding an option to throw multiple dices at the same time. Some CSS transitions or animations would also be cool here.

## Task 2:

Create a rock / scissor / paper game for 2 players. Here are some requirements.

- The players should both start with providing their name. Names of the players should be stored in localstorage.
- After inputting name, the number of rounds should be decided by the users.
- The players should take turn giving their input. Input should be possible via buttons on the screen, and via keyboard ('r', 's', 'p').
- Once both players have given their input. There should be a countdown on the screen (setInterval / setTimeout are useful functions). Before the winner of the round is revealed.
- The result should be saved in localstorage, to persist the results.
- At the last round, the game total score should be revealed together with the result of the last round.
