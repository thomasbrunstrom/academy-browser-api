# 4_2_3 Storage

## Task 1a:

Go back to the click counter, and persist the click count using a cookie.

## Task 1b:

Create a "restart" button that deletes the cookie. Make sure the count is now back to 0.

## Task 2:

Do the same as in task 1a and b. But this time around in local storage.

## Task 3:

Make sure that if the count is above 100, above 20 or divisible with 3, 5 or 3 and 5, that the text and buttons are correct from the start.
