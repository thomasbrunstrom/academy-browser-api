# Simple Dom Interactions

Use the file [4_2_1.html](./4_2_1.html) to get started

## Task 1:

Make the click counter work (when you click the button, the count increases in the paragraph).

## Task 2:

If the count is divisible with 3, the text in the paragraph should be red. If the count is divisible with 5, the color should blue. If the count is divisible with both 3 and 5. The text should be green. In all other cases, the text should be black. You have to use JS to set the color (so the element.style object).

## Task 2b:

Doing CSS with javascript is weird. So change the code from task 2 to use CSS classes instead. You will now have to remove any color class that should not be there when the count is not divisible with 3, 5 or 3 and 5.

## Task 3:

Pro clickers should get better tooling. So when the count reaches 20, a new button should appear. The button should have the text "Pro click +10". And it should add 10 to the counter instead of one.

## Task 4:

After the count passes 100, the pro button should add 20 to the count instead. The text within the button should change accordingly. And so should the design of the button itself. It should now have an image of a lightning icon, and that image should be injected through innerHTML. Also, style the button to look even more pro!
